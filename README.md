# Persian support for Typora

[Typora](https://typora.io) has limited and experimental RTL support by setting CSS attribute`direction` to `rtl` on editor style, but doing so every time you boot it up is a huge pain. So I decided to modify one of built-in themes to be RTL by default.

This theme is based on Typora's "Github" theme and includes the infamous "Vazir" Persian font.

## Usage

Download the repository (or one of its releases) as a zip file, then extract contents inside of "Typora-Persian" into Typora themes folder.

To find out where themes are stored, follow this procedure:

```
Typora > File > Preferences > Open Theme Folder
```

After extracting/copying the theme, restart the application and from Themes select Persian.
