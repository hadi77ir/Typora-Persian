# Persian support for Typora

[Typora](https://typora.io) has limited and experimental RTL support by setting CSS attribute`direction` to `rtl` on editor style, but doing so every time you boot it up is a huge pain. So I decided to make `subthemes` of built-in themes to be RTL by default.

These themes are based on Typora's `Github` and `Night` themes and do include the infamous [Vazir](https://rastikerdar.github.io/vazir-font/) Persian font.

## Usage

Download this repository (or one of its releases) as a zip file, then extract contents inside of "Typora-Persian" into Typora themes folder.

To find out where themes are stored, follow this procedure:

```
Typora > File > Preferences > Open Theme Folder
```

After extracting/copying the theme to this folder, restart the application and from `Themes` menu, select `Persian` or `PersianNight`.
